## Implementation

### Q: What kind of architecture did you use?
Bloc Pattern Has been used in This Application. Clean Code and S.O.L.I.D also Applied by having Data Layer, and Presentation Layer.
We Aimed to use Clean Architecture but for this scale we did not define Domain Layer and all its responsibilities has been done in BLOC.


### Q: What libraries did you add to the app? What are they used for?
Insert your answer here

- get_it: for Dependency Injection
- equatable: for overriding the == operator as well as hashCode in dart.
- flutter_bloc: for implementing BLOC Pattern and defining Bloc, Events, States.
- http: for Network Calls.
- data_connection_checker: for checking internet connectivity.
- json_annotation: for json Mapping to Object.
- cached_network_image: for loading image urls and caching mechanism.
- intl: for date conversion and localization / globalisation
- url_launcher: for making phone calls, sending emails, and opening WhatsApp
- liquid_pull_to_refresh: for implementing pull to refresh on candidates list  
- mockito: for Writing Test Cases.
- build_runner: for json Mapping to Object.
- json_serializable: for json Mapping to Object.
 



## General

### Q: How long did you spend on the test?
It took me approximately 5 to 7 hours to complete and test the task.

### Q: If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
For Sure, I would have completed my Test Cases to follow the T.D.D approach precisely. I also would like
to have caching and data persistence in such scenario. I would also spend some times on Animations and Design and test the app on variety of 
Android and IOS devices with different sizes.   

### Q: Which parts of your submission are you most proud of? And why?
The foundation of the app, Writing logic, and applying best practises to have a lightweight application.
Separation of concerns and creating reusable components is another one that I believe it has to be mentioned.
I am also sensitive when designing based on mockups and the Responsive UI I Created that works on different Devices.


### Q: Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
I did not find anything difficult in this task. However, I Invest my time on Analysing the task to Create the base of the project and decide on Architecture. 
I also Spend time on Designing pages Especially Details Page as Flutter has Declarative UI and its time consuming to design such that page.  

### Q: How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test or our API, we'd love to hear them.
It was challenging and informative. In particular, the UI part was designed Perfectly and for this Task I needed to setup a normal real
project foundation. Overall, I believe, its is Testing all aspects of mobile development.
I suggest that you could improve the json feeds that comes from server. some POST, methods and Authentication scenario could be added to see how 
a mobile Developer handle Session, Authentication, Authorization, and Local Data Persistence.
